    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a simple question-answering agent that is able to learn from any text data you provide, and answer queries posed in natural language. You will use IBM Watson's cloud-based services to process the input text data and find relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cloud-based NLP service instance and configure it.\n",
    "- Ingest a set of text documents using the service and analyze the results.\n",
    "- Accept questions in natural language and parse them.\n",
    "- Find relevant answers from the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Watson's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [IBM Bluemix platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).\n",

    "#### Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "Each relation is essentially a deeper analysis of a sentence (or part of a sentence). Here is a sample relation:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"sentence\": \" During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.\",\n",
    "  \"subject\": {\n",
    "    \"text\": \"Rebel spies\",\n",
    "    \"keywords\": [\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"text\": \"Rebel spies\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"action\": {\n",
    "    \"text\": \"managed to steal\",\n",
    "    \"lemmatized\": \"manage to steal\",\n",
    "    \"verb\": {\n",
    "      \"text\": \"steal\",\n",
    "      \"tense\": \"future\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"object\": {\n",
    "    \"text\": \"secret plans\",\n",
    "    \"keywords\": [\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"text\": \"secret plans\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    " }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, Watson seems to have done a pretty good job of extracting some meaning from the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Find a relation where the extracted meaning is not as accurate, or not what you would've expected. List the `sentence`, `subject`, `action` and `object` parts as identified, and what you would've marked instead.<br />\n",
    "(_Hint: Look for `\"relations\"`._)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: \n",
    "```json\n",
    "A: { \"sentence\": \" During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.\", \"subject\": { \"keywords\": [ { \"text\": \"Rebel spies\" } ], \"text\": \"Rebel spies\" }, \"action\": { \"verb\": { \"text\": \"destroy\", \"tense\": \"future\" }, \"text\": \"to destroy\", \"lemmatized\": \"to destroy\" }, \"object\": { \"sentimentFromSubject\": { \"score\": -0.754579, \"mixed\": false, \"type\": \"negative\" }, \"sentiment\": { \"score\": 0.748639, \"mixed\": false, \"type\": \"positive\" }, \"text\": \"an entire planet\", \"keywords\": [ { \"text\": \"entire planet\" } ] } },\n",
    "  In this example, action of destroying an entire planet has been related to Rebel spies in a sense that they want to destroy the planet. However, ability of destroying the planet is actually refering to Death Star, so the correct keyword in above relation would have been DEATH STAR and not Rebel spies.\n",
    "```\n",
    "As I understand from the example above, the keyword should be DEATH STAR instead of Rebel Spies. From this sentence *the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet*, we can see that the ability of destroying the planet is referring to DEAT STAR. \n",
    "#### Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that Watson identifies some `\"keywords\"` in the relations, e.g. `\"Rebel spies\"` and `\"secret plans\"` in the Star Wars example above. The output also contains a list of all keywords at the top level, for your convenience, along with their relevance to the document and sentiment conveyed. Let's visualize these keywords as a word cloud!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We'll be using this handy [worldcoud library](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) to generate the visualization. So you will need to install it first:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install wordcloud\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to understand questions posed in natural language, we'll use another Watson service called [Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/index.html). It can be used to design conversational agents or _chatbots_ that exhibit complex behavior, but for the purpose of this project, we'll only use it to parse certain kinds of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Conversation service instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you did for the Discovery service, create an instance of the Conversation service. Then launch the associated tool from the service dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-tooling.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Tool homepage\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A _workspace_ allows you to keep all the items you need for a particular application in one place, just like an _environment_ in case of the Discovery service. Create one called \"Bookworm\" with a suitable description, such as \"I know a lot of stories. Ask me a question!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-workspace.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Blank workspace\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This should open up a blank workspace, where you can add intents, define the entities you want the agent to idenitfy and structure the overall dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add intents\n",
    "\n",
    "An _intent_ is the goal or purpose of a user's input. Create a set of intents (at least 3) that capture the different kinds of questions that you want the system to answer, e.g. _who_, _what_ and _where_. Along with each intent, add a list of user examples or _utterances_ that map to that intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could enter the following examples for the _where_ intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where is the Jedi temple located?\n",
    "- Where was Luke born?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conversation service recommends at least 5 examples for each intent so that Watson learns how to recognize it. These don't have to be very precise, but more examples the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-intents.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Intents listed\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to create your own intents, based on the kinds of questions you want the system to answer, e.g. \"How many ...\", \"What are the most common ...\" etc. Each intent will need to be mapped to an appropriate query.\n",
    "\n",
    "> See [**Defining intents**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/intents.html) for a helpful video and further instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What intents did you add to the Conversation service instance?\n",

    "**A**:\n",
    "what, who and where\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Pick one of these intents, and list at least 5 examples for the intent that you entered.\n",

    "**A**:\n",
    "\n",
    " - what did Leila hide in R2-D2?\n",
    " - what does Anakin begin to have vision of?\n",
    " - who is Luke's Father?\n",
    " - where do Luke and R2-D2 crash land?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add entities\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your intents set, let's tell the service what entities we want it to identify. One way to do this is using the tool interface, and entering them one-by-one.\n",

Also, I would like to give credits for the sentiment analysis and relations resulted from the analysis of the sentences of the Discovery Service.\n",

    "However, I found the conversation service less useful since the we are heaviliy required to hand-coded the questions and actions. I have some experience in building a chatbot with deep neural network. It was relatively easy, what I need to do is to give a lot of close-domain conversational data and the model will learn either to ask approriate question or to answer appropriately. \n",
